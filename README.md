# fork of pnet simulator by @igorakim

- [original repo link](https://github.com/igorakim/pnet-simulator)
- [original demo link](http://petri.hp102.ru)

Notice: I'm not taking part in original project, just pulled to play with it, found a little, but annoying bug and fixed it for myself.

Notice: This (as the original is) could be run via `file://` protocol (it has no backend). So in fact you don't need an Internet connection to run it when you clone the repo. So to run without Internet:
 1. Pull this (or original) repo.
 2. Find `index.html` file in project folder and open it via your browser.
